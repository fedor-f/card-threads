# card-threads
The whole point of this app is to try threads in Java.<br/>

This is a simulation of a card game where one particular player is a thread.<br/>
The game lasts 10 seconds and players take turns taking random cards so they increase their balance.<br/>
In the end of the game the score of players is shown.<br/>
There is also cardsharpers mode where there are cardsharpers among normal players so these cardsharpers can steal points from normal players.
